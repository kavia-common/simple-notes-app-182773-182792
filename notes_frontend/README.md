# Old Notepad â€“ React Notes App

This is a themed notes frontend implementing an "old notepad" aesthetic with:
- Create, edit, delete notes
- Persistence via localStorage
- Responsive layout and accessible keyboard/focus states

Run:
- npm start (dev server at http://localhost:3000)
- npm run build (production build)

Textures:
Place these image textures in public/textures/ for full visual quality:
- paper.png
- paper-lines.png
- torn-edge.png
- leather-header.png

If textures are missing, gradients provide a reasonable fallback but visuals will be less detailed.
